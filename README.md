What?
-----

We built a robotic ukulele !
This project was born during the amazing [Science Hack Day](http://sf.sciencehackday.com).

We explored the propagation of sound waves through a gaseous medium,
when originating from a soprano stringed instrument as activated by
an electronic agent.

A demo video is available [here](http://youtu.be/mMed1_d50ag) but we're in [boing boing](boingboing.net/2013/12/03/video-of-2013-science-hack-day.html) and [NPR](blogs.kqed.org/science/video/200-geeks-24-hours-science-hack-day) too!
